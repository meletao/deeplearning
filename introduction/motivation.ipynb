    "Before going futher, I would like to mention that I prefer learning things at my own pace, nurturing each concepts, analyzing them critcally, making observations, doing experiments to understand better. Doing things this way takes time and to be honest, the pace at which this field is currently evolving is ridiculous. It feels so overwhelming to even think of how much ground needs to be covered. I have attempted to get into this field multiple times in the past but for some reason I feel that I did it the wrong way.  In my previous attempts, I watched and follow along so many Youtube tutorials on this topic which definitely felt good while doing it but I personally do not remember any shit after a while. One thing I'm certain about myself is that I only tend to remember and internalize things that I have experimented myself.\n",

    "- It covers a really wide ground from the very basics of tensors to transformer architecture.\n",
    "- It has got code snippets in the books that makes it great for trying out myself."
